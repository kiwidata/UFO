# UFO

## Overview of Project

Support Dana in providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Provide filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The new webpage allows someone to filter for the following criterias : date, city, state, country, and shape.

Please follow the steps below for a walkthrough of the process.

Step 1: Initial Page (Default)

Step 3: Reset filters by removing all inputted information in the filters

## Summary

One drawback of this new design is the fact that we have to input exact information in the filters, and the user might not be aware of the filter choices.

Two recommendations:
1) Implement value dropdown filters with all the choices available
2) implement a filter reset button on the webpage
